# webscraping-workshop

### The Idea

This exercise was to create a very basic webscraper. I opted to scrape the stocking stuffers from orvis.com's gift section.

Steps:
1. go to orvis.com/gifts
2. click on the stocking stuffers link
3. grab the name of each of the stocking stuffers - they all have a class name of 'TNAIL_PFName'
4. map through each of these and grab the innerText
5. return the names to the console
